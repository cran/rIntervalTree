Description: This tool can be used to build binary interval trees using real number inputs. 
    The tree supports queries of intervals overlapping a single number or an interval (start, end). 
    Intervals with same bounds but different names are treated as distinct intervals. 
    Insertion of intervals is also allowed. Deletion of intervals is not implemented at this point.
